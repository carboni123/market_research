Below is an example of how you might build an automated alert system in Python to monitor recurring corporate, economic, and political events. The idea is to aggregate information from reliable RSS feeds and APIs, filter the content based on keywords (such as “FOMC”, “GDP”, “merger”, “election”, etc.), and then trigger an alert (e.g., send an email, log to a file, or push a notification).

Below is a simplified code snippet using Python’s feedparser and schedule libraries:

```python
import feedparser
import schedule
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

# Define RSS feed URLs for different event types:
RSS_FEEDS = {
    "central_banks": [
        "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm",  # You may need to convert to RSS or use a wrapper
        "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/html/index.en.html",      # ECB press releases
        # Add BoJ and Bank of Canada feeds or use an aggregator if available
    ],
    "economic_data": [
        "https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/economic/",                   # Yahoo Finance economic calendar
        "https://tradingeconomics.com/calendar",                          # Trading Economics calendar
    ],
    "corporate_events": [
        "https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/earnings/",                   # Yahoo Finance earnings calendar
        "https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings",                  # Nasdaq earnings calendar
    ],
    "political_events": [
        "https://www.reuters.com/rssFeed/politicsNews",                     # Reuters Politics RSS
        "https://www.bloomberg.com/politics",                              # Bloomberg Politics (if available as RSS)
    ]
}

# Define keywords for filtering relevant events:
KEYWORDS = [
    "FOMC", "Fed", "ECB", "BoJ", "Bank of Canada",
    "interest rate", "quantitative easing", "CPI", "PCE", "nonfarm payroll", "GDP",
    "manufacturing", "retail sales", "housing starts", "consumer confidence",
    "earnings", "merger", "M&A", "spin-off", "dividend", "stock split",
    "election", "referendum", "political uncertainty", "tariff", "trade dispute",
    "geopolitical", "conflict", "war", "terrorist", "sanction"
]

def check_feed(url):
    """Parse an RSS feed and return a list of alerts if the entry contains relevant keywords."""
    alerts = []
    feed = feedparser.parse(url)
    now = datetime.now()
    # Check entries from the past day
    for entry in feed.entries:
        # Use 'published_parsed' if available:
        if hasattr(entry, 'published_parsed'):
            entry_date = datetime.fromtimestamp(time.mktime(entry.published_parsed))
        else:
            # If not available, assume the entry is new
            entry_date = now
        if now - entry_date < timedelta(days=1):
            # Search for keywords in title or summary
            content = (entry.title + " " + entry.get("summary", "")).lower()
            if any(keyword.lower() in content for keyword in KEYWORDS):
                alerts.append({
                    "title": entry.title,
                    "link": entry.link,
                    "published": entry_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
                })
    return alerts

def send_email_alert(alerts):
    """Send an email with the list of alerts. (Configure SMTP settings accordingly.)"""
    if not alerts:
        return

    body = "\n\n".join([f"{alert['title']}\nLink: {alert['link']}\nPublished: {alert['published']}" for alert in alerts])
    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg['Subject'] = "Market Alert: New Significant Event Detected"
    msg['From'] = "youremail@example.com"
    msg['To'] = "recipient@example.com"

    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.example.com", 465) as server:
            server.login("youremail@example.com", "yourpassword")
            server.sendmail(msg['From'], [msg['To']], msg.as_string())
        print("Email alert sent.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error sending email:", e)

def process_feeds():
    """Check all feeds and trigger alerts."""
    all_alerts = []
    for category, urls in RSS_FEEDS.items():
        for url in urls:
            alerts = check_feed(url)
            if alerts:
                all_alerts.extend(alerts)
    if all_alerts:
        # For now, we'll print the alerts and send an email notification
        for alert in all_alerts:
            print(f"ALERT: {alert['title']} - {alert['link']} (Published: {alert['published']})")
        send_email_alert(all_alerts)
    else:
        print("No new alerts.")

# Schedule the feed processing job every hour:
schedule.every(1).hours.do(process_feeds)

print("Starting alert system. Press Ctrl+C to exit.")
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

### How It Works:

1. **Feed Parsing:**  
   The script uses the `feedparser` library to parse RSS feeds from your specified sources.

2. **Filtering by Keywords:**  
   For each feed entry published within the last day, it checks if any of the defined keywords appear in the title or summary.

3. **Alert Generation:**  
   If relevant events are found, they are added to an alerts list.

4. **Notification:**  
   Alerts are printed to the console and an email is sent using Python’s `smtplib`. (You can also extend this to push notifications or integration with services like Slack or Telegram.)

5. **Scheduling:**  
   The `schedule` library runs the `process_feeds` function every hour, but you can adjust the frequency as needed.

### Next Steps:

- **RSS Feeds & API Integration:**  
  For some sources (especially official central bank pages), you might need to either use an RSS converter or leverage APIs if available.

- **Data Storage:**  
  Consider using a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) to store processed events and avoid duplicate alerts.

- **Enhancements:**  
  You can incorporate NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy or NLTK) to perform more sophisticated content filtering and sentiment analysis on the feed entries.

This structure provides a scalable and flexible way to integrate alerts for recurring events. Would you like further details on any part of this system or suggestions on advanced features?
