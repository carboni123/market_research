**If you were to create an alert system for this events, how would you do it? Personally, I would create a list for the month, then one for each week and finally I would set up a reminder in the previous day  of the beginning of the event. What's your suggestion?**

One effective approach is to build a layered alert system that aligns with the frequency and importance of the events. For example, you could:

1. **Monthly Overview:**  
   Create a master calendar listing all expected economic releases, central bank meetings, and recurring corporate events for the month. This lets you see the big picture and plan ahead.

2. **Weekly Sub-Calendars:**  
   Break down the monthly list into weekly segments. Each week’s sub-calendar would highlight the events scheduled for that week, along with their expected impact (e.g., volatility level). This helps in more focused planning and allocation of attention.

3. **Daily Reminders:**  
   Set automated alerts (e.g., via email or your mobile device) one day in advance of each major event. These alerts can include key details such as the event type, expected volatility, and any preparatory steps (like reviewing your portfolio or adjusting risk settings).

4. **Integration with Real-Time Data:**  
   Consider integrating your system with real-time data feeds (from sources like Bloomberg, Reuters, or even APIs from economic calendar providers). This allows you to update your calendar if there are any last-minute changes or unexpected events.

5. **Customization and Tiering:**  
   You can further tailor alerts by categorizing events into tiers based on their historical impact. For instance, Tier 1 might include Fed meetings and major earnings releases, while Tier 2 might include routine data like building permits. This way, you can assign different levels of urgency to each alert.

This multi-layered system—combining a monthly master view, weekly focus, and daily reminders—ensures you’re well-prepared and can react in a timely manner to changes in market conditions. It also allows you to filter out noise and concentrate on the events that matter most to your strategy.
