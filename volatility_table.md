Below is a suggested ranking of these recurring events by their typical impact on market volatility. Note that the ratings can vary depending on how much the actual data or announcement deviates from market expectations, but generally:

---

**1. Regular Economic Data Releases**

- **Monthly Reports (Nonfarm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate, CPI):**  
  **Very High.**  
  These reports are closely watched and often cause significant market moves if the data differs from forecasts.

- **Quarterly Reports (GDP, Industrial Production):**  
  **High.**  
  Important for gauging overall economic health. While highly anticipated, their impact tends to be somewhat less immediate compared to monthly data.

- **Weekly Data (Initial Jobless Claims):**  
  **Moderate.**  
  Although they can move markets, these releases are frequent and tend to produce smaller, more routine adjustments in market sentiment.

---

**2. Scheduled Monetary Policy Announcements**

- **Central Bank Meetings (FOMC, ECB, BoJ, Bank of Canada):**  
  **Very High.**  
  Their decisions and the accompanying communication can dramatically shift market expectations and drive substantial volatility.

- **Press Conferences & Minutes Releases:**  
  **High to Very High.**  
  These offer additional nuance (or uncertainty) and can either reinforce or overturn expectations. Ambiguous or surprising details can push volatility into the very high range.

---

**3. Recurring Corporate Events**

- **Earnings Seasons (Quarterly Earnings Reports):**  
  **High.**  
  Earnings releases are key events for individual stocks and sectors. Surprise results (positive or negative) can trigger significant price moves and, by extension, broader market volatility.

- **Other Corporate Announcements (Dividends, M&A, Product Launches):**  
  **Moderate.**  
  While these events can affect individual stocks, their overall impact on market volatility tends to be less dramatic than earnings surprises.

---

**4. Calendar Anomalies and Technical Factors**

- **Day-of-the-Week / Turn-of-the-Month Effects:**  
  **Low.**  
  Although they are well documented, their effect is typically small and consistent, resulting in only modest volatility.

- **Options Expiration & Rebalancing Days:**  
  **Moderate.**  
  These technical events can cause short-term volatility spikes as traders adjust positions. Their effect is generally limited to short-term market noise rather than fundamental shifts.

This layered ranking helps in designing an alert system where you might prioritize alerts from sources covering "Very High" and "High" impact events (e.g., monthly economic reports and central bank meetings) while still monitoring the more routine "Moderate" or "Low" triggers for additional context.
