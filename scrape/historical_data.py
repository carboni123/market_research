You are provided with input representing a historical data page for a stock. The input may be either an HTML version of the webpage or a JPG screenshot containing the historical data table. Your task is to extract the relevant numerical data for three different time intervals:

Last 30 Days
Last 48 Weeks
Last 60 Months
For each period, please extract the following fields (if available):

Date
Open Price
High Price
Low Price
Close Price
Volume
Requirements:

Output the results in JSON format with three top-level keys: "last_30_days", "last_48_weeks", and "last_60_months".
Under each key, provide an array of objects. Each object should represent one data record with keys: "date", "open", "high", "low", "close", and "volume".
If a particular data field is missing for any record, set its value to null.
Focus solely on extracting data relevant to these periods and fieldsâ€”do not include any additional commentary.
