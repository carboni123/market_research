keywords.py

This script provides two main functionalities:
1. A pre-defined list of market-related keywords.
2. Extraction of portfolio-specific keywords based on a user portfolio file 
   and the current date.

The portfolio keywords are constructed by combining each stock's security name 
with its corresponding earnings quarter and year. For BDR stocks (identified by 
"34" in their ticker), the quarter is adjusted forward by two quarters; for other 
stocks, the quarter is adjusted backward by one quarter.
